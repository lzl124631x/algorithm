# Introduction

I put all my notes for algorithms here.

* Gitbook: [https://liuzhenglaichn.gitbook.io/algorithm/](https://liuzhenglaichn.gitbook.io/algorithm/)
* Github Repo: [https://github.com/lzl124631x/algorithm](https://github.com/lzl124631x/algorithm)

## Remember during interview

* Disambiguate the problem, ask questions, try to understand the inputs and outputs.
* Think about edge cases.
* First talk about the brute force solution, then think about better approaches.
* Think out loud!
